# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Clayton J. Green**, a passionate developer focused on creating websites and games. Iâ€™m currently certified in **Python** and **HTML/CSS**, while expanding my skill set with **Java**, **JavaScript**, **C++**, and **C#**. I find coding exciting and love solving problems, although I thrive best when provided with clear directions.

I'm an **ambivert**, enjoying social interaction but equally valuing my own space to focus. I believe in strong values like **respect**, **good manners**, and ensuring the physical and mental well-being of those around me.

I aim to keep things lighthearted and fun, often joking around while enjoying the process of development. Coding is a balance of creativity and logic for me, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
